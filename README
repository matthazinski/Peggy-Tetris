FIXME:
- IsGameOver() also needs to NOT return true if there is a new block falling downwards that is not impeded by other blocks on the board --mhazinsk
- There is no class support in C. Board should be an integer 2D array, not a class --mhazinsk

Formatting guidelines:
- Limit lines to ~80 characters --mhazinsk
- Use four-space indents, NOT tabs --mhazinsk

Potential future problems:
- The Peggy is limited to 14 kB of (compiled) flash memoruy
- 16 MHz (?) CPU speed
